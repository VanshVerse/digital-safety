      <h2>How Cyberbullying Happens in Real Life</h2>

      <div class="chat-bubble">
        <strong><mark>Scenario 1:</mark></strong> <b>A student named Riya uploads a dance
         video on Instagram. Her classmates start posting comments like
  “cringe,” “you look weird,” and tag others to laugh. Riya feels embarrassed,
   deletes the video, and stops posting anything online.</b>
      </div>

      <div class="chat-bubble">
        <strong><mark>Scenario 2:</mark></strong> <b>In a school WhatsApp group, someone creates
        a fake account using Aarav’s photo and sends rude messages. Other students 
        believe it’s Aarav and start ignoring him. Aarav feels helpless and scared to speak up.</b>
      </div>

      <div class="chat-bubble">
        <strong><mark>Scenario 3:</mark></strong> <b>During an online game, a player keeps
        targeting one student, calling them names like “loser” and “noob.” 
        The student feels bullied and stops playing the game, even though it was their favorite.</b>
      </div>

      <div class="chat-bubble">
        <strong><mark>Scenario 4:</mark></strong> <b>A student shares a funny meme in a group.
         Another student edits it to make fun of them and spreads it across other groups.
          The original student feels insulted and starts avoiding school friends.</b>
      </div>

      <h2>What Can We Learn?</h2>
      <p><b>These situations may seem small, but they can deeply affect someone’s
         confidence and mental health. Cyberbullying is not just about jokes — it’s about 
         how those jokes make someone feel. If you see bullying, don’t join in. Be the one
          who supports and speaks up.</p></b>

      <p><b>Students should remember: online actions have offline consequences.
 Let’s build a respectful and safe digital environment where everyone feels included and valued.</b></p>
