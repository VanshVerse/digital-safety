      <h2>What is Cyberbullying?</h2>
      <p><b>Cyberbullying is the act of hurting someone through digital platforms 
        like social media, messaging apps, or online games. It includes sending mean 
        messages, spreading rumors, sharing embarrassing photos, or creating fake
         profiles to insult or harass someone.</p>

      <p>For students, understanding cyberbullying is very important.
         As we spend more time online for studies and entertainment,
          we must learn how to behave responsibly and respectfully.
 Cyberbullying can happen anytime, anywhere ‚Äî even outside school hours.</p>
      </b>
      <h2>Common Forms of Cyberbullying</h2>
      <b>
      <ul>
        <li>Posting rude or insulting comments on Instagram or YouTube</li>
        <li>Creating fake accounts to tease or impersonate someone</li>
        <li>Sharing private photos or videos without permission</li>
        <li>Sending threatening or abusive messages on WhatsApp</li>
      </ul>
    </b>
      <h2>Why is it Dangerous?</h2><b>
      <p>Cyberbullying can seriously affect a student‚Äôs mental health.
         It may lead to stress, anxiety, fear, and even depression.
          Victims may feel isolated and lose interest in school or social life. 
          That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to speak up and support each other.</p>
      </b>
      <h2>Be a Responsible Digital Citizen</h2><b>
      <p>Always think before you post. Words can hurt more than actions. 
        If you see someone being bullied online, don‚Äôt stay silent ‚Äî report it,
 support the victim, and be kind. Let‚Äôs make the internet a safe space for everyone.</p></b>
